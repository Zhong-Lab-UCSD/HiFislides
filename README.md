# Workflow

Note that here we use dummy codes just to provide and overview of the main steps of the workflow.

## 1. Deduplication of spatial barcodes (L1R1)
```
surfdedup AAAL33WM5:1:1 *_L1R1.fastq.gz > L1R1_dedup.fasta 2>L1R1_dup.txt
```
**Arguments**  
1. Identifier of the surface on recycled flowcell. For example, AAAL33WM5:1:1 indicates that the deduplication will be performed on the top surface (surface 1) of lane 1 of flowcell AAAL33WM5. 
2. The filename identifier of several L1R1 fastq files.

**Purpose**  
Remove redundant spatial barcodes. This script reads raw reads from recycled flow cell and adds "_N" to the identifier of each read, where N is the number of times the read is found on the surface (i.e. one spatial barcode could be found at N different coordinates on the surface). This script considered only reads from the surface identified by argument 1. 

**Output**  
The output of surfdedup includes two files:

1. `L1R1_dedup.fasta`: fasta file with deduplicated read sequences (obtained from STDOUT). 
2. `L1R1_dup.txt`: txt file listing all the read identifiers that shared the same read sequence. Note that when N reads shared the same sequence, only 1 of the N read identifiers would be randomly chosen and printed to `L1R1_dedup.fasta` while the remaining N - 1 read identifiers would be shown in N - 1 rows in `L1R1_dup.txt`.
  

## 2. Align HiFi-Slide R1 reads to deduplicated spatial barcodes

Aligner BWA was used to map HiFi-Slide R1 reads (L2R1) to deduplicated spatial barcodes `L1R1_dedup.fasta`.

First, we create bwa index from `L1R1_dedup.fasta`:
```
bwa index -p L1R1_dedup L1R1_dedup.fasta
```
Then, we align HiFi-Slide R1 reads `L2R1.fastq` to the deduplicated spatial barcodes:

```
bwa mem -a -k 40 -t 32 L1R1_dedup L2R1.fastq > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.log
```

# 3. Select HiFi-Slide R1 reads with highest alignment score
```
hifislida.pl L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.e
```

**Arguments**  
1. Output SAM file from BWA.  

**Purpose**   
Read the SAM file output from BWA and collect the spatial barcodes aligned with each HiFi-Slide R1 reads at the highest alignment score. If a HiFi-Slide R1 read was aligned with N spatial barcodes that tied at the highest score, all the N spatial barcodes will be outputted except when N > 1,000. Spatial barcodes aligned with lower score would be discarded.

**Output**
Tab-separated file `L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o` with the following columns:

- Column 1: HiFi-Slide read ID. 
- Column 2: Spatial barcode read ID. Each spatial barcode ID provide its spatial coordinates explicitly.  
- Column 3: Number of non-redundant spatial barcodes aligned at the highest score.  
- Column 4: Number of all the spatial barcodes aligned at the highest score.  
- Column 5: Highest alignment score between this HiFi-Slide R1 read and the aligned spatial barcode.  


## 4. Identify the Region of Interest (ROI)

```
hifislida2.pl L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida2.o 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida2.e
```

**Arguments**  
1. Output file produced by hifislida.pl.
2. Output file produced by BWA.

**Purpose**  
Count the number of HiFi reads per tile. A total of 6 X 11 tiles are available on NextSeq flowcell (sometimes they could be 6 X 14). We hypothesize that spatial barcodes on tiles covered by tissue should be mapped with more HiFi-Slide R1 reads than spatial barcodes outside the tissue covered region. To this end, we count the number of HiFi-Slide R1 reads per tile. To have a simplilified solution, we only consider HiFi-Slide R1 reads that have only one unique spatial barcode with the highest alignment score on the surface.       

**Output**  
Tab-separated file `L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o` with the following columns:

- Column 1: Tile ID.  
- Column 2: Number of spatially resolved HiFi-Slide R1 reads per tile (ranked in descending order).

If tiles with high number of HiFi-Slide R1 reads tend to be located in proximity, that may indicate these tiles were covered by the tissue.

## 4. preprocessing of HIFISLIDE R2 reads  
By design, HIFISLIDE R2 sequenced the tissue RNA. It is the RNA end. In practice, one issue was the read throught by HIFISLIDE R2 into the spatial barcode. If occurred, HIFISLIDE R2 could carry sequence of the R1 from the recycled flowcell. To identify such cases, we search for the illumina R1 primer in HIFISLIDE R2 and also search for the overlap between HIFISLIDE R1 and R2 per read pair. The latter task was performed by PEAR v0.9.6 using default parameters. We excluded HIFISLIDE R2 that overlap with HIFISLIDE R1 or mapped with illumina R1 primer.  
Next, we used ``fastp`` to further process HIFISLIDE R2 reads. We had 6 different options for processing.


Option 1
```
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o L2R2_1x2_trim_tail1_1.fastq --trim_tail1 80 --disable_quality_filtering --thread 16 > someo 2>somee;date
```

Option 2
```
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o L2R2_1x2_trim_front1_1.fastq --trim_front1 60 --disable_quality_filtering --thread 16 > someo 2>somee;date
```

Option 3
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q0
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 4
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q1
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_front --cut_tail --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 5
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q2
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_front --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 6
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q3
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_tail --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```


Here ``L2R2_1x2.fastq`` is the fastq of filtered HIFISLIDE R2 reads that not overlapped with HIFISLIDE R1 and not mapped with illumina R1 reads primer. Processed reads were then mapped to human genome using STAR or mapped to human transcriptome using BOWTIE2.  


## 5. annotate HIFISLIDE R2 reads by genes

Two different strategies were applied.  
(1) we used STAR to align HIFISLIDE R2 reads to genome and then used bedtools to obtain annotated genes per HIFISLIDE-mapped genomic locus.  
(2) we used BOWTIE2 directly map HIFISLIDE R2 to transcriptome.
For STAR usage, we set --outFilterScoreMinOverLread and --outFilterMatchNminOverLread to be 0 as [SeqScope](https://github.com/leeju-umich/Cho_Xi_Seqscope/blob/main/script/align.sh).
For BOWTIE2, we used default setting with the local alignment mode.  
If a HIFISLIDE R2 read could be mapped to a gene using one or both strategies,it would be counted for that gene.


## 6. Integrate spatial coordinates and gene information for each HiFi read pairs.
Results from Step 3 and 5 would be intergrated to provide gene annotation for each spatially resolved HIFISLIDE read pair. The output of this step would be   
column 1 - Tile ID  
column 2 - X-coord  
column 3 - Y-coord  
column 4 - HIFISLIDE Read ID  
column 5 - Gene
