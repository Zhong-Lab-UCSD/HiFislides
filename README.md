# Workflow

Note that here we use dummy codes just to provide and overview of the main steps of the workflow. More information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MvXPgTVzzeAEnmRXDRuaJMY-U_ENorQMPzqpLVOJWA0/edit#).

## 1. Deduplication of spatial barcodes (L1R1)
```
surfdedup AAAL33WM5:1:1 *_L1R1.fastq.gz > L1R1_dedup.fasta 2>L1R1_dup.txt
```
**Arguments**  
1. Identifier of the surface on recycled flowcell. For example, AAAL33WM5:1:1 indicates that the deduplication will be performed on the top surface (surface 1) of lane 1 of flowcell AAAL33WM5. 
2. The filename identifier of several L1R1 fastq files.

**Purpose**  
Remove redundant spatial barcodes. This script reads raw reads from recycled flow cell and adds "_N" to the identifier of each read, where N is the number of times the read is found on the surface (i.e. one spatial barcode could be found at N different coordinates on the surface). This script considered only reads from the surface identified by argument 1. 

**Output**  
The output of surfdedup includes two files:

1. `L1R1_dedup.fasta`: fasta file with deduplicated read sequences (obtained from STDOUT). 
2. `L1R1_dup.txt`: txt file listing all the read identifiers that shared the same read sequence. Note that when N reads shared the same sequence, only 1 of the N read identifiers would be randomly chosen and printed to `L1R1_dedup.fasta` while the remaining N - 1 read identifiers would be shown in N - 1 rows in `L1R1_dup.txt`.
  

## 2. Align HiFi-Slide R1 reads to deduplicated spatial barcodes

Aligner BWA was used to map HiFi-Slide R1 reads (L2R1) to deduplicated spatial barcodes `L1R1_dedup.fasta`.

First, we create bwa index from `L1R1_dedup.fasta`:
```
bwa index -p L1R1_dedup L1R1_dedup.fasta
```
Then, we align HiFi-Slide R1 reads `L2R1.fastq` to the deduplicated spatial barcodes:

```
bwa mem -a -k 40 -t 32 L1R1_dedup L2R1.fastq > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.log
```

## 3. Select HiFi-Slide R1 reads with highest alignment score
```
hifislida.pl L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.e
```

**Arguments**  
1. Output SAM file from BWA.  

**Purpose**   
Read the SAM file output from BWA and collect the spatial barcodes aligned with each HiFi-Slide R1 reads at the highest alignment score. If a HiFi-Slide R1 read was aligned with N spatial barcodes that tied at the highest score, all the N spatial barcodes will be outputted except when N > 1,000. Spatial barcodes aligned with lower score would be discarded.

**Output**
Tab-separated file `L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o` with the following columns:

- Column 1: HiFi-Slide read ID. 
- Column 2: Spatial barcode read ID. Each spatial barcode ID provide its spatial coordinates explicitly.  
- Column 3: Number of non-redundant spatial barcodes aligned at the highest score.  
- Column 4: Number of all the spatial barcodes aligned at the highest score.  
- Column 5: Highest alignment score between this HiFi-Slide R1 read and the aligned spatial barcode.


## 4. Identify the Region of Interest (ROI)

### Rank the tiles by number of HiFi-Slide read pairs

```
hifislida2.pl L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o L2R1__L1R1_dedup.sam > L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida2.o 2>L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida2.e
```

**Arguments**  
1. Output file produced by hifislida.pl.
2. Output file produced by BWA.

**Purpose**  
Count the number of univocally resolved HiFi reads per tile. A total of 6 X 11 tiles are available on NextSeq flowcell (sometimes they could be 6 X 14). We hypothesize that spatial barcodes on tiles covered by tissue should be mapped with more HiFi-Slide R1 reads than spatial barcodes outside the tissue covered region. To this end, we count the number of HiFi-Slide R1 reads per tile. To have a simplilified solution, we only consider HiFi-Slide R1 reads that have only one unique spatial barcode with the highest alignment score on the surface, which means considering only rows in `L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o` where both columns 3 and 4 are equal to 1.       

**Output**  
Tab-separated file `L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida2.o` with the following columns:

- Column 1: Tile ID.  
- Column 2: Number of spatially resolved HiFi-Slide R1 reads per tile (ranked in descending order).
- Column 3: Number of mapped barcodes per tile.

### Select tiles under ROI

If tiles with high number of HiFi-Slide R1 reads tend to be located in proximity, that may indicate these tiles were covered by the tissue.

Algorithm explained in the Google Doc, script `xxx`.


## 5. Match HiFi-Slide read pairs with spatial location 

Note: output filename to be changed to something better!!

```
hifislida3.pl L2R1__L1R1_dedup.hifislida.o ROI_tiles.txt L1R1_dup.txt > hifislida3.o
```

**Arguments**  
1. Output file produced by hifislida.pl.
2. Output file produced by `xxx` with the IDs of the tiles under ROI.
3. The second output file from `surfdedup`. This file provides duplicate spatial barcodes whose IDs were not shown in the output from `hifislida.pl`.

**Purpose**  
With `hifislida.pl` we obtained aligned deduplicated spatial barcodes with the highest score for each HiFi-Slide read pair. These HiFi-Slide read pairs were considered as spatially resolved. With `hifislida2.pl` we ranked tiles by their number of spatially resolved HiFi-Slide read pairs and we could manually select a few tiles as our ROI. To integrate these results we use `hifislida3.pl` to obtain all the aligned spatial barcodes located within the ROI and print out their coordinates on each tile. Notably, when multiple spatial barcodes share the same sequence but from different coordinates, `hifislida3.pl` prints out all their coordinates.

**Output**  
Tab-separated file `hifislida3.o` with the following columns:

- Column 1: HiFi-Slide read ID.
- Column 2: Tile ID (only tiles under the ROI provided as input).
- Column 3: X-coord on the tile (columns).
- Column 4: Y-coord on the tile (rows).
- Column 5: N as the number of total spatial coordinates where this HiFi-Slide read could be aligned to spatial barcodes. This is used to "weight" HiFi-Slide reads. For example, if a HiFi-Slide read has N = 8, it would be counted as 1/8 at any of these 8 coordinates.

## 5. Preprocessing of HiFi-Slide R2 reads  

By design, HiFi-Slide R2 sequences the tissue RNA (RNA end of the read pair). 

In practice, one issue was the read throught by HiFi-Slide R2 into the spatial barcode. If occurred, HiFi-Slide R2 could carry sequence of the R1 from the recycled flowcell. To identify such cases, we search for the illumina R1 primer in HiFi-Slide R2 and also search for the overlap between HiFi-Slide R1 and R2 per read pair. The latter task was performed by PEAR v0.9.6 using default parameters. We excluded HiFi-Slide R2 that overlap with HiFi-Slide R1 or mapped with illumina R1 primer.  
Next, we used ``fastp`` to further process HiFi-Slide R2 reads. We had 6 different options for processing.


Option 1
```
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o L2R2_1x2_trim_tail1_1.fastq --trim_tail1 80 --disable_quality_filtering --thread 16 > someo 2>somee;date
```

Option 2
```
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o L2R2_1x2_trim_front1_1.fastq --trim_front1 60 --disable_quality_filtering --thread 16 > someo 2>somee;date
```

Option 3
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q0
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 4
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q1
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_front --cut_tail --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 5
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q2
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_front --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```

Option 6
```
p=L2R2_1x2_processed_Q3
fastp -i L2R2_1x2.fastq -o $p.fastq --disable_quality_filtering --trim_poly_g --trim_poly_x --cut_tail --thread 16 > $p\o 2>$p\e
```


Here ``L2R2_1x2.fastq`` is the fastq of filtered HiFi-Slide R2 reads that not overlapped with HiFi-Slide R1 and not mapped with illumina R1 reads primer. Processed reads were then mapped to human genome using STAR or mapped to human transcriptome using BOWTIE2.  


## 5. annotate HiFi-Slide R2 reads by genes

Two different strategies were applied.  
(1) we used STAR to align HiFi-Slide R2 reads to genome and then used bedtools to obtain annotated genes per HiFi-Slide-mapped genomic locus.  
(2) we used BOWTIE2 directly map HiFi-Slide R2 to transcriptome.
For STAR usage, we set --outFilterScoreMinOverLread and --outFilterMatchNminOverLread to be 0 as [SeqScope](https://github.com/leeju-umich/Cho_Xi_Seqscope/blob/main/script/align.sh).
For BOWTIE2, we used default setting with the local alignment mode.  
If a HiFi-Slide R2 read could be mapped to a gene using one or both strategies,it would be counted for that gene.


## 6. Integrate spatial coordinates and gene information for each HiFi read pairs.
Results from Step 3 and 5 would be intergrated to provide gene annotation for each spatially resolved HiFi-Slide read pair. The output of this step would be   
column 1 - Tile ID  
column 2 - X-coord  
column 3 - Y-coord  
column 4 - HiFi-Slide Read ID  
column 5 - Gene
